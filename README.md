# Project Title
Crowdfunding via Smart Contracts

## Project Description
This project implements a simple crowdfunding platform using Ethereum smart contracts. It allows users to create campaigns with specific funding goals and enables others to contribute funds to these campaigns. Once a campaign reaches its funding goal, the funds are transferred to the campaign creator.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a decentralized and transparent platform for crowdfunding, where creators can raise funds for their projects without relying on traditional financial institutions. This will empower individuals and small businesses to bring their ideas to life while ensuring that contributors can track the progress of their investments.

## Key Features
- **Campaign Creation**: Users can create a new crowdfunding campaign by specifying a funding goal.
- **Funding Mechanism**: Contributors can fund campaigns by sending Ether directly to the smart contract.
- **Automatic Fund Transfer**: Once a campaign reaches its funding goal, the funds are automatically transferred to the campaign creator.

## Future Scope
- **Campaign Duration**: Implement a time limit for campaigns to reach their funding goals.
- **Refund Mechanism**: Allow contributors to withdraw their funds if the campaign does not reach its goal.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Enable funding in multiple cryptocurrencies.
- **User  Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface for easier interaction with the smart contract.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights and analytics for campaign creators and contributors.
